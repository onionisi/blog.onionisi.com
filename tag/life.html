                        <h5>New Beginning</h5>
<p>a fresh start of another month
so I restart using todo app on iphone 
since my android phone cracked by the backdoor of my car
According to the keep record
It's already 42 days when I do keep last time
so shame</p>
<p>yesterday new plan was made on the TickTick app
including 4 list
routine, repeated daily
career, repeated daily too
australia, you known that
urgent, remind important event</p>
<p>AWS CSA has the highest priority
So tonight official course commence
after a series free video by linuxacademy
I choose acloud guru
I like the 'guru'</p>
<p>I complete all the task of Today
So fabulous
when you feel too hard you are close to your goal
just stand with it for a couple of minutes
the best illustration was last night
I learned how to strike water with foot in freestyle</p>
<p>Since I learned frogstyle, it's nearly 15month
Motivated by my dear wife who was taught by me with frogstyle, 
deciding learn freestyle by herself because of her swimming teacher without this ability,
I started to practice only using leg in freestyle.
I nearly dropped out after my body drifting through half lane of the pool,
because I can not control my body to move forward.
It was so frastrating.
Thanks for the short distance to another end, I made up my mind to finish this trip.
Like a engine, I made my leg switched up down more faster.
That was it.
Finally, my legs propel the whole body fast forward.
Getting new skill make people extremely thrill.
Next, its time for the arm part.</p>
<p>Nothing is easy in the beginning
keep on</p>
